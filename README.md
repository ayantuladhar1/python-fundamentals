# Core-Python
Key Characteristics:
Ordered: Items have a defined sequence, which will not change unless modified through specific methods like sort() or reverse().
Changeable (Mutable): You can modify, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.
Allows Duplicates: Because items are indexed, a list can contain multiple items with the same value.
Indexed: Items can be accessed using an index, starting from 0 for the first element. Negative indexing allows access from the end (e.g., -1 refers to the last element).
Flexible Data Types: A single list can contain items of different data types (strings, integers, booleans, etc.) simultaneously.
