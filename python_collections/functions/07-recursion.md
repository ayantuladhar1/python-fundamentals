# Python Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls itself.
Recursion is common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function call itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.
The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

## Example:
A simple recursive function that counts down from 5:
```python
def countdown(n):
  if n <= 0:
    print("Done!")
  else:
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)
countdown(5)
```

## Output
5
4
3
2
1
Done!

## Base Case and Recursive Case
Every recursive function must have two parts:
* A base case - A condition that stops the recursion
* A recursive case - The function calling itself with a modified argument

Without a base case, the function would call itself forever, causing a stack overflow error.

## Example:
Identifying base case and recursive case:
```python
def factorial(n):
  # Base case
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  # Recursive case
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))
```

## Output
120

The base case is crucial. Always make sure your recursive function has a condition that will eventually be met.

## Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence start with 0 and 1:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
The sequence continues indefinitely, with each number being the sum of the two preceding ones.
We can use recursion to find a specific number in the sequence:

## Example:
Find the 7th number in the FIbonacci sequence:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return n
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(7))
```

## Output
13

## Recursion with Lists
Recursion can be used to process lists by handling one element at a time:

## Example:
Calculate the sum of all elements in a list:
```python
def sum_list(numbers):
  if len(numbers) == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return numbers[0] + sum_list(numbers[1:])

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_list(my_list))
```

## Output
15

## Example:
Find the maximum value in a list:
```python
def find_max(numbers):
  if len(numbers) == 1:
    return numbers[0]
  else:
    max_of_rest = find_max(numbers[1:])
    return numbers[0] if numbers[0] > max_of_rest else max_of_rest

my_list = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]
print(find_max(my_list))
```

## Output
9

## Recursion Depth Limit
Python has a limit on how deep recusion can go. The default limit is usually around 1000 recursive calls.

## Example:
Check the recursion limit:
```python
import sys
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
```

## Output
1000

If you need deeper recurion, you can increase the limit, but be careful as this can cause crashes:
## Example:
```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
```

Increasing the recursion limit should be done with caution. For very deep recursion consider using iteration instead.
