# Python Casting
## Specify a Variable Type
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-oriented language, and such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
	• Int()- constructs an integer number from and integer literal, a float literal (by removing decimals), or string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
	• Float()- constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or integer)
	• Str()- constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals.
