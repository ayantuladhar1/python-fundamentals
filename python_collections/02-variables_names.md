# Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

## Rules for Python variables:
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
* A variable name cannot be any pf Python Keywords such as:
