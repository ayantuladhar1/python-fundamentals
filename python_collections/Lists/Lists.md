# List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of a 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
List are created using square brackets.

## Example:
```python
thislist = ["apple","banana", "cherry"]
prrint(thislist)
```

## List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

## Ordered 
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the first.

## Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general, the order of the items will not change.

## Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

## Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

## Example:
List allows duplicate values:
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana', "cherrry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```
