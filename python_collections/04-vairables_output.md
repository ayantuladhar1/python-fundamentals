# Output Variables
The print() function is often used to output variables.

In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by comma:

You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".
For numbers, the + character works as mathematical operator:

In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error.

The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types.
