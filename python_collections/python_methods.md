# What is a Method?
* A method is a function that belongs to an object(list, string, dictionary, etc.).

# Difference:
* Function: woks independently
* Method: is called using an object such as (object.method())

# String Method:
```python
	name = "python data engineer"
	print(name.upper())
	print(name.title())
	print(name.replace("python", "java"))
```
