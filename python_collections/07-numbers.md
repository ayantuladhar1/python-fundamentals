# Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:
	• int
	• float
	• complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function

## Int
Int, or integer is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

## Float
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

## Complex
Complex numbers are written as "j" as the imaginary part.

## Type Conversion
You can convert from one type to another with int(), float() and complex() methods

## Random Numbers
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
